You look around and you see a few people you recognize, but you don't know them well. You see a few people you don't recognize, but they seem friendly. But all of them were chatting excitedly about this new technology that has just started getting steam. To your left is a door marked 'SOL 03'. Maybe it has something to do with Mars. You look to your right and see an opening to a garden. Finally, further ahead you see some tables with what looks to be packaged snacks. Maybe they have Coke Zero. Want to go forward and see?",
