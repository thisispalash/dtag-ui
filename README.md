## dextra (ui)

This is the (incomplete) UI for [dextra](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/dextra-9wnc2), a project built at [ETHGlobal San Francisco 2024](https://ethglobal.com/events/sanfrancisco2024/). This repository is archived and the new frontend code can be found [here](https://github.com/thisispalash/dtag-react). To see details about the project at the hackathon, please see the [hackathon entrypoint](https://github.com/thisispalash/ethglobal-sanfrancisco-2024).

### About

`dextra` is the hackathon name of the project dTAG, decentralized Text Adventure Games. The game is inspired from an assignment in a functional programming class. You can find the assignment [here](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2016fa/a2/a2.html). I never actually completed the assignment on time in the class and have wanted to complete the assignment ever since. When I found out about composable NFTs, dTAG became a project! I love trying to insert web3 in everything, and this is somewhere where it actually fits! dTAG is a platform where users can create or play text adventure games; the key difference? Composability! ie, an item created by one user in one adventure can have utility in another adventure by another user! Truly, a game that can exist only because of web3!

The first attempt at this was in 2022, with [Polygon's BUIDL IT hackathon](https://buidlit.devpost.com/), but [not much accomplished](https://github.com/thisispalash/dTAG) at the time. [ETHGlobal San Francisco 2024](https://ethglobal.com/events/sanfrancisco2024/) then provided a great space to explore and refine the project further. And now, with additional feedback and some more iterations, it is live! Head on over to [the website](https://dtag.thisispalash.com/) to check it out!!
